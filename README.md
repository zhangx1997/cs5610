1.What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
Working 5 files at the same time and improve final deliverable can be challenging. It is fun but hard. Took me about a week to do this.

2.What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I tried to adjust nav padding and margin-top so that contents can be seen on mobile end. My nav bar kept hiding my contents. Finally things worked out.

3.What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
Making a website that can be accessed by people is always something can be proud of. Content of course is something I took into account, but spend more times finding the best value for margin-top where my contents won't be hidden by nav bar.

4.Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
More links, more contents, more css animation and interactive elements, better color contrasts, etc.

5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
Roughly a week.
